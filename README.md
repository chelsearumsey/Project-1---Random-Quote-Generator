# Random Quote Generator 

For this project, I have created an app that displays random famous quotes each time a button is clicked. 
I used my knowledge of basic JavaScript syntax, variables, loops and object literals to complete this project:
1. I located and selected my own quotes 
2. Built an array of quote objects to store the quotes
3. Wrote my own functions for selecting random quotes from the array and printing them to the screen.
